# Apex-Pizza
This is Apex Pizza mini project
# 🍕 Apex-Pizza

A lightweight **PHP mini project** that simulates a pizza shop ordering system.  
It’s designed to demonstrate **core PHP concepts** like form handling, routing, and basic MVC structure — perfect for beginners learning backend web development.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📋 **Menu display** — shows pizza names, descriptions, and prices.  
- 🛒 **Order system** — users can select pizzas and place simple orders.  
- 🧩 **MVC-style structure** — separates logic (controllers), data (models), and presentation (views).  
- 🌐 **Routing** — each page (menu, order, checkout) handled by PHP routing logic.  
- 💾 **Data handling** — stores pizza data in arrays (no database required).  
- 🧱 **Easily extendable** — add a database, authentication, or admin panel later.

## 🧠 Why This Project Is Useful

- Great for **learning PHP fundamentals** through a fun, real-world example.  
- Encourages **clean structure** instead of mixing PHP and HTML in one file.  
- Provides a **foundation** to expand — like adding login, order history, or REST API endpoints.
